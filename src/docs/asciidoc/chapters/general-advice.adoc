== General Advice

=== Process

1. Define scenario to improve
2. Profile scenario
3. Identify biggest bottleneck
4. Fix bottleneck
5. Verify fix by measurement
6. Repeat

=== Automate your measurements

```# Scenarios are run in alphabetical order
assemble {
    # Run the 'assemble' task
    tasks = ["assemble"]
}
clean_build {
    versions = ["5.0", "5.3", "/Users/me/gradle"]
    tasks = ["build"]
    gradle-args = ["--parallel"]
    system-properties {
        key = "value"
    }
    cleanup-tasks = ["clean"]

    run-using = tooling-api // can also be "cli", "no-daemon"
    warm-ups = 10
}
```

=== Stay Up-To-Date

- Gradle wrapper

```
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 5.3
```

- android version
- thirdparty plugins
- annotation processors

=== JVM tuning

Provide enough heap space

Other tweaks often do more harm than good

Spend your time on structural improvements

=== The Gradle Daemon

The gradle daemon is enabled by default

Provides a number in in-memory caches

Useful for repeated builds

Do not disable it!
